The teams are very colloquial and comfortable with each other, therefore it doesn't seems too uptight. I loved my boss.","Very old fashioned. The decor is very old fashioned cubicle like (not too modern, like google, or facebook, etc.). All engineers have to wear business casual while other workers can wear anything (it felt superioristic). My superiors to my boss seemed so political and not engineering oriented. Meetings made every second of every day.",
26-Jan-16,1,Aerospace Program Manager,I was able to work on exciting technologies in very competitive environments. I would recommend this company to those that like to thrive in an ever changing environment.,No work life balance. Project implementations required 80 hour work weeks and when finished a 50 hour standard work week was expected. All core functions seemed to be going to contractors and not Honeywell Employees.,

02-Feb-16,1,Save the Stockprice,"Generally great people to work with. The benefits are decent, for the most part. Shifts are reasonable.","People are laid off in one breathe and they are celebrating making all of the company goals, including income. People need to do more with less people.

04-Feb-16,1,Good employer,"Constant work, good hours and safe working environment.",Health insurance not great. Contract position.,
04-Feb-16,1,finance intern,great company where you can learn about a lot of different functions. They tend to promote from within which is good for moral and overall atmosphere.,the pay is pretty stagnant if you take part in their analyst program. Although they promote from within it may not be suitable for the more ambitious types.,
05-Feb-16,1,Once a great place to be an engineer,"Stable, well-performing publicly owned company. CEO has done a good job maximizing the value to shareholders. Good benefits but costs now being passed on to employees.","Aerospace division suffers from glut of politically correct middle-managers with little talent and no vision, a functional matrix organization where no one is in charge but everyone can block progress, job deflation caused by export of real engineering work to 'high-growth' regions of the world, and hyper-focus on process improvement and project (micro) management over pragmatic engineering excellence to get results.",
05-Feb-16,1,Review,Large business with a global foot print,Many jobs moving to China,
06-Feb-16,1,Cote - Break 'er up!,Steady employment until you get MULA'd.,Benefits decreading every year. Conglomerate setup is not focused on growth marlets and stagnant.,

08-Feb-16,1,"Manager, Project IT",Wonderful people on team. Demanding and fast paced environment. Good place to work if you are young and right out of school.,"No room for promotion unles you are one of the chosen few. Lousy merit increases. Always rumors of reductions in force. Management in Aerospace are always crying slow performance yet attend expensive resorts for meetings, fly internationally when not required, and take pay cuts out on the workers exempting themselves. Then they turn around to Wall Street and say that they beat their performance forecast.",
09-Feb-16,1,Human Resource Manager,Being a diversified manufacturer provides many different opportunities in terms of locations and industries. Having portfolio divisions allows Honeywell to ride out economic down-cycles better than most other firms. Progressive HR that values business partnering and business acumen. Great training for early career HR professionals.,"A company this size will obviously have politics, red tape, and bureaucracy. Career development support can be spotty and highly dependent on who your specific manager is.",

10-Feb-16,1,Operator,Great company to be able to advance and retire.,"Sometime working in extreme weathers can be challenging. Also, sometimes long hours of having to work overtime is difficult but it works for me.",
10-Feb-16,1,Areospace,Some very good people to work with around the country.,Constant knowledge drain throughout the aerospace division due to poor decisions in upper managements desire to globalize.,

13-Feb-16,1,Good Company if you can travel,Plenty of locations and positions. You can grow your career through internal transfers.

15-Feb-16,1,Don't see a long future here... but not by my choosing.,"Great Pay. A lot to learn. Friendly, helpful employees.","Most manager do not have machining experience or knowledge. Employee satisfaction is not good, nor a focus. Constant rumors and signs company will be moving all work south of the border.",
15-Feb-16,1,project engineering in Space electronics,"Compensation is fairly competitive as other similar size corporations likes GD, except for company sponsored health insurance. Good compensation for 401k match, 75%. Salary range is about market value.","Work is more exciting at commercial aviation segments, space and defense mostly have maintenance programs, and not so much going with Cost plus programs. Most of the big programs normally go budget overrun. There is mandatory overtime (now politically referred to as ""Engineering Efficiency Index"") 10% requirement highly encouraged and is tracked for performance review and merit determination. The issue with it is that it makes it difficult to meet the ""OT"" yield when work is slow but you're still expected to fulfill that objective. Otherwise, you get busy and go easily over 10% with the active ramp-up projects. Budget for burden projects are not approved easily.",
16-Feb-16,1,CM Analyst,"I enjoyed working with the engineers outside of my department, the money was decent for first job out of college. My supervisor did the best with what she had.",The politics in my department. Benefits were not good. No upward mobility. The outlook of my location was pretty vgrimat the time I left. No training whatsoever.,
17-Feb-16,1,Production Assembler,A very friendly place.,nothing bad to say about this company,
18-Feb-16,1,unfair treatment,The company has good pay and has good benefits. Has been stable since 2009 about providing jobs in a bad situation.,the company will have a set of rules that only applies to certain people when they want to like tardiness and absenteeism and production quotas,

Great job security with a lot of opportunity for growth and/or advancement, especially for those early in career.","Benefits have been changing rapidly over the last three to four years. 401k matching is reduced, healthcare has moved to High Deductible Healthcare Plan without a reduction in premiums. Pensions are no more for new hires.",
21-Feb-16,1,Marketing Manager,"Work flexibility (work from home), large company that does provide advancement opportunity (especially if you're willing to travel), stable organization that delivers on shareholder expectations","Disconnected leadership, convoluted processes that are seldom followed, continually dwindling resources and hardcore cost-cutting culture, poor benefits (very high healthcare deductibles), extremely controversial biometric screening requirement (Honeywell is currently being sued by the Federal Government for this), slightly lower pay across the board (but especially in marketing), layoffs and offshoring at every turn, challenging business outlook (for our particular business unit)",
21-Feb-16,1,Manager Manufacturing Equipment,Autonomous ability to drive daily results and alignment to greater results across site. Company is very people focused and drives to satisfy customers.,"As a manufacturing site in the US many resource are difficult to get, constant starts and stops in converting temp labor to perminate frustrates everyone in the process.",

24-Feb-16,1,Corporate overhead is burdensome but good work/life balance,"Immediate business leaders are well thought of, very good work/family balance, many people have worked here a very long time","Corporate overhead in terms or reporting monthly financial metrics can be over bearing.

26-Feb-16,1,Great company to start a career,Great company with flexible working schedule. The offer multiple opportunities and career advancement,Work can be slow in the beginning and take a while to get moving for most people.,
26-Feb-16,1,Subcontract Manager,Working with very smart engineers who re some of the best people around,"***Stay away from this company***Leadership is very shallow and any promotion is based on facade, golf connections and office romance! Your skill sets are purely secondary!~Metrics are constantly shifting higher with the intent to make the obese CEO richer ; pay raise / pay increases are tragic.",
29-Feb-16,1,Honeywell Review,"This was the greatest job I ever had. The job i had was so high profile with the government that engineering had final say over anything related to production. It was really nice having professional who understood what was most important for the quality production of hardware and importance of the customers needs.I felt I was thanked and well considered when I pointed out minute micro flaws plaguing a functional surface. Always receiving the work instructions to correct it or an excellent answer to continue processing as normal. I was never told ""because I said.""I helped build products I was 100% confident were built right because I had this this support to fall back on when I needed.","Cost cutting culture concerning manpower and resources, Constant expectations to meet budget and schedule milestones that seem to be unattainable.",
29-Feb-16,1,"Meh! Lots of hours, little fun, stable employment","I feel my position is stable. In addition, there are many other opportunities in a company this size. Those opportunities can be in a different field or different business unit and even a different industry.",The company is very focused on a lean operation - to the extent that it becomes hard to get anything done. Everyone is overworked. People you rely on are slow to respond -or just flat out tell you they can't support you. But that doesn't stop the pressure to produce. Company culture is all about getting the job done. There is no sense of team. You are a small cog in a big machine.,
01-Mar-16,1,Director learning,Great team and well run company,Large dispursed organization makes working in teams a challenge.,
02-Mar-16,1,Honeywell,"Great products, great people, great work environment.",Many previous benefits have been reduced and/or increased employee contributions towards benefits.,
02-Mar-16,1,Engineering Manager Thoughts,"Honeywell demands great behaviors and code of conduct. It has good positions in good/growing business segments. Honeywell has a fabulous CEO, Dave Cote, who has vision and tremendous business sense.","The industry, and Honeywell's, move to higher deductible health care plans has made it difficult for many singles and families.",
02-Mar-16,1,Not Bad nor too good to work with,Flexible work hours and lot of things to learn,Payments are on very low side,
02-Mar-16,1,HSE,"Some truly talented professionals, but they don't stay very long.",No on-boarding/orientation for staff members. Huge programs that are continuously being changed and modified. Huge staffing issues. Low pay forced time off without pay. Little to no support from upper management. Completely a matrix driven company (Check the box whether it is correct or not and move on),
02-Mar-16,1,"Poor benefits, tiny or 0 raises","There seems to be good job security. Hours are not too strenuous: 45 hours per week. Willing to support continuing education. Working with a diverse, cross-functional and international team.","Upper management does not seem to care about retaining talent in engineering. Lots of perks and attention to the business functions, but none given to engineering except for pats on the back when things go well. Tiny raises in good years, zero raises in times of economic uncertainty (so guess how often that happens). Very little opportunity for advancement. Benefits, specifically health care, are terrible. Health care has very high premiums and is a high deductible plan - it's supposed to be one or the other. The message we hear every day is that the stockholders are the only people who matter - this results in a short-term perspective that is all about stock price today.",
05-Mar-16,1,Honeywell - Overall great workplace,Salary is competitive. Plenty of room for growth and movement to various disciplines based on size of company and multiple nearby sites.,Top heavy in management. Aviation is currently in a lull.,

08-Mar-16,1,Working for Honeywell,Great people make the job rewarding. Opportunities to be promoted from within.,"Company made 38.6 Billion in 2015, no one got raises. Excessive overtime. Company does more to keep shareholders happy than they do employees. Distribution Centers (Warehouses) increase profit by shipping orders early to customers, even taking shipments out through the following month to increase revenue in the current month. This increases demand on man-hours to make up the lost revenue the following month and then compounds overtime to show false profits.",
09-Mar-16,1,Program Manager,Professional Engineers are top notch,A lot of paperwork involved,

15-Mar-16,1,Move on if you are able,Hardworking and talented co-workers. Work was varied and sometimes challenging. Most times replacement tools or upgraded equipment was not hard to request and receive.,"You are expected to put in constant overtime - hourly or salary - even if there isn't enough work to justify it. Stack ranking style reviews. Micromanagement through the use of HOS rules right down to what you can throw in your trash can. A pay scale that used to be transparent - now it is a big secret. Lack of merit raises or promotion on said secret pay scale. Benefits that have been constantly culled. Only high deductible insurance plans available with health screening requirements to get a ""discount"". Workers treated like kindergartners with respect to safety i.e no pointed scissors allowed.

16-Mar-16,1,Staffing Specialist,Honeywell is a huge company with great brand recognition. I have worked here a very long time and have learned a lot. Work long hours but management is very flexible.,Benefits seem to get worse and worse as times goes on.,
16-Mar-16,1,Great People!,The people here are very knowledgeable and helpful. You learn so much from people that have been in the industry for 20+ years.,"There is too much focus on finances and budgets, management is pressured to reduce cost to serve, and high level management is only looking out for company profits.

What benefits high deductible insurance but they are ""generous"" to cover the monthly fee for your insurance card.

19-Mar-16,1,Overall good experience. Good people and the company is always looking to push it's employees up the ladder.,"Great pay, fair training and good opportunity. Some management will listen and not micro manage, some won't. Also great training for moving on outside of Honeywell.","Way to much checking, re-checking and re-checking the already re-checked.

You may learn some good concepts but never get to implement them.,No raise 2 out the 4 years. HR is horrible they let the union employees get away with murder.

So you are pushed and measured by schedule but they put barriers all along the way like failure is by design.Jobs are sent to China or India even if you can show that it is cheaper to do it here.

30-Mar-16,1,Honest Review,The people are the best asset to this company. They are friendly and knowledgeable. The work is very interesting and challenging. I really like my boss and find he is very supportive of my work.,Honeywell is adding so many tools and processes and requirements to the responsibilities of a design engineer that it is impossible to truly focus on creating quality designs. The network and CAD system are the worst I have ever seen and as a former design engineer contractor I have seen at least 10 other well performing systems. The upper management is so focused on profit that it has lost it's ability to see why its implementation of new processes and tools are costing money.,

Stagnant wages, below average benefits (and getting worse) and a customer base that hates doing business with us.

They cut or shutdown their supply depots, 5S their spare inventory out of the building and then question why production is down.Their motif is a corporate greed motif. Layoff employees.

Great place to learn how to be a TOXIC LEADER and TOXIC MANAGER. It will teach you the dark arts of creating a toxic environment. Great place to develop neither EFFICIENCY NOR CREATIVITY. I am making this place my scientific project to determine what this environment breeds.No growth but a good place to warm your chair for 10+ years in one position and then hop to the adjacent cubicle for another 10+ years if you are that type with no ambitions.They have outsourced their relocation services to cheap companies like SIRVA which handles the supposedly difficult conversations since Honeywell's advice to them is to discourage by every means necessary to provide any benefits to the employee.You will learn to be a SLAVE in this Company by the time they are done with you. You will seek neither COIN, FAME, POSITION, SUCCESS OR POWER in this firm but end up losing it after selling your rights and privileges.

It is a trailer park in the Phoenix facility.3) Harmful and toxic emissions that are inhaled in this facility. Management simply avoids the topic and avoids cleaning up the junk.4) Employees are given desks and chairs that are over 30 years old. They are broken and quite some of them got hurt.5) Management does a scavenger hunt around the junkyard, dumpsters and trash collection points to find cables, cords, chairs, desks, materials etc.6) Even Senior managers are placed in cubicles and expected to share it with other team members in some occasions. Even they use dumpster chairs.7) The building is packed like sardines.8) Facilities need serious attention and overhaul. Most of them don't even meet the fire code and building safety codes. It looks like old mud hills from the 1960s9) There is barely any young person in this facility who retain their position for more than 6 months.10) The senior professionals with over 27 years of service are simply waiting anxiously to get their pension and 401(k).11) Most managers due to depression have a lackluster performance because they are asked to manage with a shoestring budget.12) They are audited for buying paper, pen, paper clips, power cords and anything over $20.13) I think the Company is politely telling everyone to leave the facility so that they can covertly discourage libels, lawsuits and severance pay for many of these professionals.14) Zero accountability from Senior Leadership. I mean absolute ZERO besides empty speeches and hollow promises that are expected to deliver no outcome. They rarely visit the plant, facilities to determine the health, safety and environment of the employees.15) All the neighboring industrial zones have been marked for restoration. In fact all the neighboring industries have had their buildings demolished.16) Going to work is an absolutely DEMORALIZING and UNHEALTHY EXPERIENCE.",

You're switching from a guy making 20$/hr to one making 40$/hr. Which would matter if you didn't rely on the ability to drive workers into overtime for free.Expectation to work overtime is inherent. Honeywells' business model involves reduction of ancillary support positions like IT and HR, and attempting to standardize and automate everything.

The overall culture was draconian and very much ""good old boys club"" but in the area where I worked and my job allowed me to, for the most part, ignore that and get my work done.","That meant ignoring a screaming, lunatic of a boss (there were far too many but I rarely saw mine), her assistant who broke down in tears 1-3 times each week, the numerous extra-marital affairs with VPs and promotion by cleavage. HR's job was to fire anyone who was a whistle blower or in any way disagreed with management. Senior managers were great (the ones I knew all left), mediocre and a bit crazy, the latter two ""styles"" fared the best.",

15-Sep-16,3,Sr. Manager,Good place to learn. Decent pay and benefits although they are declining.,"The personal touch at Honeywell Aerospace is gone and employees are a number rather than an asset. In 2016 we have taken pay cuts and unpaid furlough week off every quarter. As people leave they do not back fill and we have had 2 layoffs in the 1st 3 quarters of the year while the stocks do great and leadership gets their bonuses. The company continually cuts project and site funding needed to improve quality on rejected hardware or meet customer investigation commitments.Those of us left are expected to do more with less and cover the job responsibilities of those that have left or been laid off. Years ago, this was a great place to work, but not anymore. We are losing many talented people as they choose to seek employment elsewhere due to all of the changes and cuts.",

It is a great place to work as a Product Manager where you can use the systems in place and tools available to set, drive, and implement growth strategies in wide variety of markets.","The company, specifically the Sensing and Controls division, is fairly risk averse. Given the size of the company and the tendency to be risk averse, you can find the implantation of the projects to be slower than a smaller, more nimble company.

18-Sep-16,3,Review,"Flexible work hours. My star ratings are an average of my immediate situation of the last few years, my situation the decade before that, and what I see going on among all the people with whom I work.My immediate manager is an amazing anomaly, constantly pushing us to move up the ladder, explaining the boxes that need to be checked off so upper management can't block our promotions and how to navigate the god-awful politics and get around the massive road block that is ""HR"", the Lawsuit Prevention Squad. Upper management would get rid of him if they knew what he was doing for us as it goes against the one and only commandment of ""Thou Shalt Cut Costs At All Cost!."" None of the other managers I have had in the last 15 years had the stones to even try to explain what it really takes to get promoted in this environment. Just promote the ones you like. Most didn't even understand our group's true function, and considered all of us unpromotable because 'you only do ...' My present manager is the only reason I could give anything 2 stars.","Where to start...don't be fooled, darius is dave's clone without a personality (which can be pos or neg depending on your point of view). Other than the very small bubble I am currently in, what I see going on around me is appalling. The last 5-6 years have been a rapidly accelerating descent through chaos into indifference. Read the other reviews for details, what they describe is spot on. Don't be fooled by the company sponsored 4-5 star 1-2 sentence reviews that are probably required in bulk of HR minions so they can be promoted. The best employees are loaded up to the point of collapse/quitting as they try to keep things afloat with no support from their managers, the best of whom are also overloaded and completely hamstrung by upper management's greed for ever larger bonuses. The company is being hollowed out by upper management skimming off the top while the employees doing the work get less and less for their efforts. When management states there is 'really no way to measure customer satisfaction' you are forced to realize just how deep the hole you are in really is. And in spite of everything they won't stop digging; they dig faster and harder.",
18-Sep-16,3,You're Nothing But a Liability,"The pay is good, but you'll earn it, doing the work the many who were laid off. Great opportunity to learn the jobs if many.","If you've been at Honeywell for more than 10 years, you're nothing but a financial burden. They're looking to get rid if you.",

28-Sep-16,3,IT at Honeywell,If you are an executive with equity compensation the stock has gone up for ten years.,Layoffs and furloughs are constant. No career paths. Morale is gone. IT function has so many controls in place you do nothing but fight through red tape. Starting a new project takes six months. Getting worse with even greater centralization of the function.

28-Sep-16,3,Honeywell is not for everyone,Honeywell has resources all over the world so you can find experts with your topic of interest literally anywhere.,"Because it is a global organization, Honeywell expects you to work around the clock. They do not hire engineers in North America because they would provide you with resources from countries such as India or China. It saves them money but it's not exactly Agile. After awhile, the long nightly scrum calls really drain you. Integration issues arise too when you count on someone so far away to provide you with software and sometimes they don't have the hardware to do the integration so you end up doing the integration.",

Middle management then tasked with setting standard to measure morale - employees caring enough about the company to submit their own ideas for ""continuous improvements"" (CI's). Lower management is tasked with achieving measurable morale in the form of the volume of CI's - two a month. Bottom management puts a gun to each employee's head and tells them they'd better turn in 2 CI's a month or it'll go in their next performance review making them vulnerable the next time they have layoffs. Employees reluctantly turn in any CI's that'll give them two a month, including things like ""found pen on floor, picked it up"". Upper management sees numbers and thinks morale goals have been met, avalanche of mostly-worthless CI's waste several people's time, and employee morale couldn't be worse. This pretty much sums up everything Honeywell does.Safety: Safety SEEMS to be a MAJOR concern for Honeywell! ... unless it's too inconvenient or expensive, then hell with ya. HSE's goal is not to keep the employees safe, but to reduce Honeywell's liability.Pay: Rates have been frozen for well over a decade. After 8 years I was still making only 76% of the industry's standard for STARTING pay in the same job.People: Most co-workers are hard-working and friendly people. Team Leads are too often unqualified simpletons with too much liability and not enough authority. Supervisors stay in their offices and don't want to be bothered with any of that work-related stuff. Upper management are usually polite but clueless. They set impossible standards based on BS numbers and the production floor creates more BS to look like they achieved it.Advancement: None. Seriously, not a chance in hell.I have never in my life worked for a company that has so perfectly represented the stereotypes of corporate bureaucracy. I don't know of anyone who works there that wants to, but they're the biggest employer in the area.",

When asked about future activities, their response is always the same...""nothing is planned"". However, a month or so later an announcement comes out about another furlough/lay off. It is foolish for executives to believe employees do not know our leaders are looking into the future. They know in advance if actions are needed and yet, they refuse to help their employees by giving as much notice as possible. They don't care. Then to add, a few weeks ago, it was announced no longer remote working was allowed...We just step backed into the 80's. No other fortune 500 company believes in this philosophy.

Pay is decent, however a good chunk of it is taken up by the ridiculous healthcare costs.","The benefits are a joke- the healthcare is astronomically expensive and there's no company match.It takes years before you get any additional vacation time added (5 years until you get an additional week) and you never get additional PTO.The work/ life balance at Honeywell is deplorable and that's attributed to the austerity measures put in by the top brass (CEO - Cote) a couple years ago, plus bad planning all the way down the leadership chain - in all business units. Simply put, if you work here you're just a number; a metric, not a person with a life outside Honeywell. And this company will work you until they either break you or lay you off. There are better and more stable engineering companies out there.Very little development or promotional opportunities unless you're in the senior, upper leadership. I rarely see regular engineers/ managers promoted to the next level in any SBU.Honeywell is a very bloated company.

The (non executive) employees are hard-working and intelligent. Pay is decent.,The benefits are horrendous for such a large company that should have significant leverage. Benefits are cut year after year. Recently remote work was banned from the CEO level. Honeywell is trying to follow an Apple or Yahoo culture but seems to lack the understanding that global teams cannot meet locally the way local companies in San Fransisco are able to. This really shows a lack of fully understanding the problem before making knee-jerk sweeping changes that significantly affect so many employees. The worst part is that just a few months ago remote work and hiring remote talent was encouraged to increase the talent pool. What happens to those employees now?

It doesn't matter that the foreign engineers are less than half as capable!This, along with cutting out Vision Insurance last year, Dental Insurance this year, and no raises in 2 of the last 4 years make this a miserable place to work. In the last 5 years they've eliminated the pension for new employees, reduced the 401k match for everyone, and ruined the benefits to the point where it's almost cheaper to get un-subsidized insurance through the exchange.Lastly, the culture is very much ""do as I say, not as I do"".

They have a good 401k plan and incentives","Honeywell is process driven to an excess - gets bogged down with a lot of corporate baggage, i.e. check box type reporting.

They also offer and in some ways promote changing positions within the company through their internal job search system.","Unfortunately for me, the opportunities to continue to work at a great company was cut short due to their unwillingness to allow for remote work/telecommuting--even though many of the projects that I would manage would be at remote locations (e.g. - not in the home office) and spent most of my time communicating with people on the phone of via Lync around the world.

There is actually a large department at corporate that is dedicated to processing layoffs and there have been so many layoffs that there are not enough people to deliver product to the customer (there are major product quality issues and most products are delivered late).Low pay scales, no merit pay raises (for the past 6 years), no bonus pay (for the past 2 years), annual pay cuts (typically 10%), and horrible benefits (high premiums; dental benefits completely cut).Low morale due to continuous layoffs, horrible management, and poor financial metrics (employees don't understand how the company reports record growth/profits to investors, but internally employees hear that revenue is down across all divisions).Management lacks integrity, ethics, and accountability (corporate lawyers make decisions based on ""We don't think we will get caught""). There are major violations of federal law that could potentially bar the company from business.Very few opportunities for employee training or career development. No career advancement opportunities.""Honeywell Operating System"" (HOS) is ridiculous - it is simply standard work that the company should already do.Declining company reputation makes it extremely difficult to recruit talent.

Now: no paid OT for exempt employees (most engineers), 401k match down to 6% (back from 3%), no pension plan for new employees, forget Christmas parties and picnics.

25-Nov-16,4,Poor management,"Pros are hard to list - there are many good people there, very bright, but management has the picture that anyone can be replaced at any time - and this is just not true.

Honeywell makes its money on acquisitions - they buy up profitable companies, consolidate and outsource jobs, steal their technologies, move to the next company and repeat...They report a profitable bottom line from the acquisitions, but internally they are cutting benefits, scrutinizing every minute expense, shutting down facilities and laying off employees.Honeywell absolutely does not care about its employees. They do not promote anyone to a manager without a Bachelors degree and director level promotions require a Masters degree. It's an unwritten rule, but they write their job descriptions to rule out people they don't want. As a result, employees with tenure from acquired companies are often overlooked and discarded. Employees are expected to work long hours, with unrealistic expectations/metrics, and are stressed to the max because of the workloads and demands. These expectations are not limited to their employees, but also to vendors that work for them and want their business. If you're looking for work-life balance, this is NOT the company for you.",

They are also not modifying delivery expectations and somehow, programs and projects will magically continue to progress despite no effort.This review is long on the short, but the work life balance, policies, and way people are treated is appalling, and many have been here so long they don't know any better. There's no way Honeywell can transition into a top-flight software company with their current mentality. There's no vision; and if there is one out there, it's certainly not shared.They've brought in some incredible talent with the lure of building some massively innovative products; but each of those products requires a death march of a project to get them done and a LOT of people are fed up.

He is trying to ensure his retirement comfort through the furloughs, layoffs, reduction in benefits, salary freezes, etc., that have been going on for years now. The company is doing well, but he is milking every dollar for the bottom line he can with these unsustainable hardships on the employees. I can't imagine there has ever been a company that has cared less about their employees. Also, management cares more about the number of overtime hours you put in, rather than any output of value or quality of work. This contributes to a terrible work culture and general lack of work-life balance.",
21-Dec-16,4,Honeywell Review,Location. Laid back work environment. Don't usually have to work OT.,Actively reducing US census. More interested in reducing cost than providing a quality product. They live quarter to quarter. Actively reducing workforce (RIFs). Periodic furloughs.,

It's a good place to get work experience.","I worked in Supply Chain Management at HON's Tempe, AZ site. High stress. No matter how much you do, it's never enough. We abused suppliers, squeezed every dime from them. Management makes unreasonable demands is if they're not met, the employee career is threatened. This is a metrics driven company. Employees are under constant fear of layoff (typically around the Holidays every year). It's a terrible, stressful environment. You've been warned.",

27-Dec-16,4,Not so concerned for employees,Lean processes and Honeywell Operating System creates a standard work environment where expectations are well know and communication freely flows from one area to another.,Company is very concerned about the bottom line to the detriment of employees. Large variances in salaries for same jobs. Reliance of contract hires with reluctance to hire or convert employees to permanent. Standardization creates machine-like workforce who no longer are able to think for themselves or solve problems quickly and efficiently.,
29-Dec-16,4,IT Manager,"Great experience working with large-scale platforms; scale was enormousPlenty of new opportunities, responsibilities and roles to explore",Demanding hoursPay scale was not commensurate with work or market standardsVery political environment- too much time spent looking for next job or protecting current job due to realignments/reorgs/layoffs,
29-Dec-16,4,engineering manager,Great team of people doing the actual work.,Benefits keep getting worst year over year. Constant threat of your job being outsources and new furloughs. The company is trying to get employees to believe working for Honeywell is a privilege and one of the company benefits. The constant reorganization has left managers unsure what their roles are. In over 40 years of work experience I have never seen a company with global moral as low as Honeywell.,

It took over a year to get to new hire orientation, and in that year I went through three managers. The first two never even had time to give me the time of day, the third acted as though I should be completely up to speed on this incredibly complex company and industry with zero training and support. The pay structure is laughable, bonuses are impossible to get because the growth number they expect from the sales rep are literally five times the number that the company projects as a whole. Constant pressure and micro management. Layer upon layer of middle and upper management. Seriously, its a nightmare...Oh yeah, how about the benefits. They only offer high deductible health plans. So my family had to pay $400 per month for medical insurance, plus a $3000 deductible before they paid for anything but routine checkups. Meanwhile the CEO gets a huge raise and Honeywell pulls in billions in profit. And NEW FOR 2017! Honeywell makes no contribution towards dental! Oh yeah, and when they eventually match your 401k contributions after a year, they do it with Honeywell stock! So if you want to invest in something else you have to go in and sell that stock and reinvest it.",
31-Dec-16,4,Product Manager,Large diverse company provides a lot of opportunities to get varied experience across multiple product types and industries.,Upper/executive management is clueless in regards to what's important to employees and often delivers tone deaf messages and mandates to the working staff.

Furloughs, no raises, terrible bonus. Very stressful, no work/family balance. No work from home policy. A culture of dishonesty with leadership and caring more about their egos than having an honest conversation about how to fix problems. Can't hire decent smart people because they are so desperate to fill roles after a hiring freeze. I have more than 25 years experience in my field and I would rather work at Menards as a cashier. This place is dismal all over the company.",

It's CONTINUOUS lay offs, pay cuts, no raises, benefit cuts... I mean continuous!! Now we have ""unlimited"" vacation meaning you are entitled to NONE and encouraged to log all of your unpaid OT. It's a contest of who can spend the most hours in the office with no vacation or flexibility and only the winners will end up with a job.

You will receive an aggressive employee discount within the branch.","I've never worked for a company that provides very minimal amount of training. Vendors would rarely come in to train, if they came in it was to meet a ""visit quota"" and leave very shortly after dropping off flyers. If you're new to the security industry this job will be a huge challenge for you. Also, you will take numerous calls a day. There's very minimal branch traffic as ADI provides drop shipping and overnight shipping. It's also team commission, so if you're use to holding your own destiny, you now rely on your team to sell and seek out new business. There's absolutely no way that they could structure commissions on an individual level however due to the size of their customers accounts.",

With a short development cycles (1-3 yrs) additional processes have increased the overall development cycle duration and cost while OEM customers expect decreasing development cycles. Executive management has recognized this and is starting to make changes.The local engineering organization, as great as it is, seems to be unable or unwilling to become excellent. A lack of vigor and/or a sense of complacency seems present.Honeywell Aerospace is a matrix organization with little on-site business presence. The ISC manufacturing support of new programs needs more of a sense of urgency early in development with a comprehensive manufacturing plan with concise objectives. The ISC leader and his management team changes every 1-2 years; it's hard to make sustainable improvements with a revolving door.Grass roots growth for the site is available, but challenging to support within the Honeywell corporate umbrella. Organizational changes on the business side are in process to improve this.Career advancement is given little effort by management, and the measurement of developing skills is ambiguous. Willingness to relocate improves your opportunity to accelerate your career growth. The executive management solution to engineering attrition has primarily been more global engineers, mainly in India. Grim outlook for new graduates in the states with this company.Vacation time starts at 2 weeks, even for experienced employees (5-10 yrs). 3 weeks at 5 years, and I believe 4 weeks at 15 years and caps at 5 weeks at 25 years.

When management was told by professionals that managers were not listening, an additional dozen or so managers were hired from internal personnel.

Work life balance is a lie they perpetuate to get people in the door. They have a huge HR organization so they know how to 'talk the talk' but dont believe it - the 'pro' mentioned above is simply their way of avoiding payout of vacation to terminated employee. This company is so disorganized, disjointed, and dysfunctional that its a wonder they continue to survive. Actually, the only reason they survive is through acquisition of companies that are more successful. It's like the aliens in the move Independence Day - they swoop in, suck all the life out of the once successful, thriving organization, and then move on to their next victim. Sad but very true.

Location is another, the Morris Plains location is beautiful and really makes coming to work everyday easy. Also, upper management gets it, they seem to be making the right moves to pull in & keep talent and to move the company in the right direction.","Honeywell is still growing out of ""old"" corporate culture. There are times when you're working on something that should seemingly be easy, but you're hit with a roadblock that may take longer than you may be used to due to un-necessarily complex processes and/or a long approval chain.

Bonuses permanently reduced to 50% of what they were and will most likely be eliminated in the next few years. Basically all benefits have been drastically cut. Multiple furlough each year with little advanced notice. Layoffs multiple times in the last year and now not enough people to complete the work. My 55 hour weeks went to 60+ due to reduction in force and programs have been put off or cancelled. No more remote working makes it difficult to work long hours and many of the best engineers are leaving due to the change. Its also caused severe over-crowding in outdated facilities. No career advancement opportunities, In my 10+ years I only saw one promotion and it was from engineer 1 to 2. Little to no merit increases (even with great performance reviews) and investment. Lots of red tape due to top leadership micromanaging every division. Going back to school was discouraged and no time with the amount of extra hours required to complete projects on reduced schedules.

Its a big business. No one cares about you or your ideas. Forget that thought that anything you learned in a degree program will matter to your job. A high school dropout with a few months of training could do your job, There is little to no engineering ever involved. Only when you need to engineer a way to do your actual job without using their broken tools and ancient processes. You will work hard but there will be some excuse why you dont get compensated for it. In fact chances are good you will either get furloughed or laid off. If you dont, you will see good people go and awful rectal-smoochers stay. The company wastes money on silly things like signs and propaganda and is constantly telling employees they are in ""bad/tough times"". Meanwhile executives get multi-million dollar bonuses even in the tough times. They don't even have the decency to accept this openly they will still insult you by pretending they are sacrificing as much as the little guy. This place slowly sucks your joy like a dementor.

18-May-17,6,Corporate Greed,"Most people have heard the name, even if they don't know what sort of products or services are offered, therefore it looks better on a resume than less well known companies.","1) Corporate greed runs rampant. One week they are sharing news of how well the company did last quarter and what great profits they had, and the next week they are sending out internal memos about spending and travel freezes so that we can perform to what the shareholders were promised. They always put the shareholders first, even when the actions to do so will negatively impact customers (many of the decrees are very short sighted). Customers come second and employees place last by a long shot.2) Honeywell buys well performing companies, takes their customer base, their IP, their suppliers, and anything else they can gut, and then outsources to the foreign country flavor of the month. If you work for a US based company that is bought by Honeywell, expect to see your job outsourced to China, Mexico, or India within 1-2 years. The outsourcing announcement was officially made at my company at the 1.5 yr mark, but the original plan began circling in upper levels of management around the 6 month mark, which is a pretty good indication that outsourcing was the plan from day 1.3) Honeywell is a ""check the box"" company. It does not matter if your actions produced valuable results, as much as it matters that you can say you did what the job required. On a regular basis, I see employees and leadership going through the motions to check the box, but not even caring about the outcome.4) Honeywell is so big that it is very common that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It is pretty much a daily occurrence in some meeting or another.5) Honeywell invests massively into ""High Growth Regions"", which includes countries like China, India, and pretty much any country where employees are paid dirt. Yet, they have no respect for the American lives that they screw up when they lay off long-term employees in order to show headcount reductions.6) Top management makes millions of dollars per year, and yet the company ""struggles"" to do well in a tight economy, so it is most important that employees understand when the blue-collar and no-collar jobs need to be cut in order for the company to look good to investors.",
20-May-17,6,"ACST -- Golden Valley, Minnesota","Honeywell is a great place for somebody who would prefer to sit back and produce literally nothing of value for years or even decades. Across Honeywell, I saw many who had mastered the art of looking busy while contributing almost nothing (aka, fake work). This is a place for someone who wants to fill their schedule with travel of dubious value or purpose.","Overall, a truly awful place to work. This is a review primarily of the ACST group, previously called SRDC and then CSTC. It will probably be renamed and re-shuffled several more times in the next 5 years. Regardless of the name, it is the group composed primarily of defense contractors in Golden Valley, MN.The defense/gov contractors get priority here. Anyone who wants to work on commercial products for regular consumers gets pushed aside. This group is simply a group of panhandlers for corporate welfare from the government.Management is incompetent. There is almost no direction from the higher ups. The only guiding motto is, paraphrasing: get more government money, and keep your work secret. The group is so heavily compartmentalized that almost no one works together. There is little sharing of knowledge and skills. I heard that some new employees sit around doing nothing with no direction. I don't feel that management encouraged or cared about my work.Management (across Honeywell) is slow at making any decisions and cannot move on opportunities. Bureaucracy is a problem.In my opinion, management, especially in ACST, is unethical and unprofessional.Gossip is a problem in ACST.The benefits at Honeywell are the worst of any company Ive seen. The companys new vacation policy of whatever number of days the employee feels like taking was an obvious theft of everyones vacation time. The health insurance is terrible with the highest deductibles and premiums of any company Ive seen. The required health screenings are awkward. Every year, management announces some new reduction in benefits. This year, they stopped subsidizing dental insurance.Despite Honeywell being founded and based in America, the broader company seems to be giving American jobs to other countries as vigorously as possible. Globalization is one of their primary goals. The outsourcing of American work is just driven by greed.In my opinion, Honeywell was at its peak circa 1960. The company has very little in-house innovation today. The products theyre in, such as thermostats, jet engines, barcode readers, and gas burners, are old technology. Honeywell just buys newer companies. When I think of high tech companies, Honeywell does not come to mind.In the broader Honeywell, Ive seen many layoffs, furloughs, and pay freezes.",

Reasonable and common-sense manager who cares more about getting the job done and done ethically rather than how or where it gets done.6.

Pretty good work life balance. Not too many others I can think of.,"Management plays favorites. Constantly going through riffs and layoffs. Even when we have a great year there will be layoffs. It's just management trying to meet their bottom line. Cost of living raises are a joke (if you even get one). If you get promoted the pay bump will make you wonder why you even tried to get a promotion in the first place. Benefits get worse every year. This year it was our health insurance that got worse as well as more expensive. Turnover rate is insane. Within two years you will see at least half the people you work with leave for a better opportunity. The only people still there are the ones with 30+ years who are grandfathered in to the pension plan. They dont do pensions anymore. They dont match 401K for the first year, and they do that probably because so many people leave after a year or two. I could go on and on but just try to find a better opportunity first.",

The inability to make decisions, along with their complete disrespect for employees shows to me that Honeywell is destined to continue to fail. Lack of innovation outside of aviation is disheartening. Peeling back benefits, the move to an annual 401K match <-- big deal to us! Honeywell has basically taken money out of our retirement plans and disguised it as ""a way to reward employees"" is essentially a way to rape us of our benefits. We all know they will do their RIF's in December. So, we not only lose those gains over the course of the year - we lose the entire match on Honeywell's whim.I left my Silicon Valley startup to try and help HON grow, man I've tried but it's a lost cause.

One bad decision after another in terms of organizational structure, endless reorgs and uninformed staffing pretty much guarantee that Honeywell will follow GE and IBM in their failure to transform from building physical things to digital.Benefits are much weaker than other similar size companies, from expensive healthcare to forced presence in the office. And this year ""innovation"" of the 401K match is truly horrible: Honeywell holds on to all employees matches till the January of the following year, this keeping to themselves all market gains of those funds. That is a robbery, loud and clear.",
